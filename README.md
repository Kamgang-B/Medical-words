# Medical-words

_Medical-words_ is a project for Python Lab subject.
The purpose of this project is to train a model that takes as input medical and healthcare words converted into images and predict them.
To each word, we will also associate its pronunciation (as a .wav or .mp3); in other words, each word will be matched to two files: an image file
containing the word and a .wav or .mp3 file containing its sound (how it is pronounced). The .wav or .mp3 files obtained will be used as input in another model 
different from _Medical-words_ project.
